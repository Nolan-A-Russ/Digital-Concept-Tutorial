# Power Supply Unit (PSU)

The Power Supply Unit (PSU) is a critical component of a computer system, responsible for converting electrical energy from an external power source into usable power for internal components. A reliable PSU ensures stable and efficient operation of all hardware.

## **How the PSU Works**
1. **Power Conversion**  
   - Converts alternating current (AC) from the wall outlet to direct current (DC) required by computer components.  
   - Common output voltages include:
     - **12V**: Powers CPUs, GPUs, and cooling fans.
     - **5V**: Used for USB ports and some motherboard components.
     - **3.3V**: Powers smaller circuits, like those on the motherboard.

2. **Power Distribution**  
   - Supplies power through various connectors:
     - **24-pin ATX Connector**: Main power for the motherboard.
     - **CPU Power Connector**: Supplies extra power to the processor.
     - **PCIe Connectors**: Powers high-performance GPUs.
     - **SATA Connectors**: Provide power to storage drives.
     - **Peripheral/Molex Connectors**: Used for older components and accessories.

## **Key Features of a PSU**

### 1. **Wattage**
- The total power output of a PSU, measured in watts (W).
- Determines the capacity to handle power-hungry components.
- Typical ranges:
  - **400–600W**: Suitable for basic systems.
  - **650–850W**: Ideal for gaming PCs with mid-range GPUs.
  - **1000W+**: Required for high-end gaming or workstation builds.

### 2. **Efficiency**
- Rated by the **80 Plus Certification** system, which indicates how efficiently the PSU converts AC to DC.
  - **80 Plus Bronze**: Standard efficiency (~82–85%).
  - **80 Plus Gold**: Higher efficiency (~87–90%).
  - **80 Plus Platinum** and **Titanium**: Premium efficiency (90–94%).

### 3. **Modularity**
- Refers to the cable design of the PSU:
  - **Non-Modular**: Fixed cables, less flexibility.
  - **Semi-Modular**: Essential cables fixed; others detachable.
  - **Fully Modular**: All cables detachable for cleaner builds.

### 4. **Protections**
- Modern PSUs include built-in safeguards to protect components:
  - **Overvoltage Protection (OVP)**.
  - **Overcurrent Protection (OCP)**.
  - **Short Circuit Protection (SCP)**.
  - **Over Temperature Protection (OTP)**.

## **Choosing the Right PSU**

### 1. **Compatibility**
- Ensure the PSU fits your computer case (e.g., ATX, SFX form factors).
- Check for the correct number of connectors for your hardware.

### 2. **Power Requirements**
- Calculate the total power draw of your system using online PSU calculators.
- Choose a PSU with some headroom above your system's needs.

### 3. **Brand and Quality**
- Opt for reputable brands like Corsair, EVGA, Seasonic, or Cooler Master.
- Poor-quality PSUs can lead to unstable systems and potential hardware damage.
